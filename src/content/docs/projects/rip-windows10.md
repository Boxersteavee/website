title: RIP Windows 10 - A Countdown to the End of an Era
description: Windows 10's end is approaching. I made a countdown clock, and wrote this article to raise awareness for what that means for you, and everyone else still running Windows 10.

Windows 10 has been a major part of many people's lives for over a decade now, at one being used by over 80% of desktop computers. I've pretty much grown up on Windows 10, and many others have too, however all good things must come to an end.

With the announcement of Windows 11 in late August 2021, Microsoft also quietly announced that Windows 10 would be reaching it's End of Life on October 14th 2025, which is now 4 months away at the time of writing. This date has been creeping closer and closer, and not many people realise how important it is. For this reason, I made a countdown clock at [RIPWindows10.com](https://ripwindows10.com), with the help of my friend [Xcissors](https://atserver.us/) to raise awareness of 
how little time we have left.
## Why is Windows 10 becoming 'End of Life' such a big deal?
Great question. Not many people seem to understand the importance of End of Life software (or even hardware). That is why I'm writing this article to raise awareness about the risks of running End of Life software.

When Windows 10 reaches it's End of Life, this means Microsoft will stop publishing Security Updates for Windows 10, and security vulnerabilities are not going to be fixed by Microsoft, even if they could severely compromise the security of your computer, or even other devices nearby.

Your computer being insecure means any time it is connected to the internet, it is at risk of being compromised by attackers, who could steal personal details, saved passwords, saved credit cards and addresses in web browsers, and even infect other machines around you (including ones that are secure and up to date).

## How could my Computer being insecure risk the security of other computers?
An alarming amount of people seem to not care about their own security, however what people fail to realise is how much of a risk they put on others by using an insecure computer.

Remember the Wannacry Virus that cost the NHS 92 Million Pounds, and estimated to have cost 4 Billion Dollars globally? Wannacry infected computers by exploiting a security vulnerability that Microsoft had already released a patch for 2 months prior to the attack, however not enough computers had been updated to this security patch.

If your computer became infected by a security vulnerability, an attacker could then attack other machines on your network by exploiting either the same, or other vulnerabilities. This is how malware like Wannacry spread, and is the reason why you should keep your computer secure. It's not just about your security, it's about the security, and safety, of others around you.

## I'm still on Windows 10? What now?
If your computer is still running Windows 10, you have probably noticed all of the popups and notices Microsoft have shoved in your face, begging you to upgrade to Windows 11. Some people think this is just Microsoft wanting to sell more data about you, which may have some element of truth, however this is not the primary reason. 

The main reason Microsoft are pushing people to upgrade to Windows 11 is to ensure your computer stays secure when Windows 10 reaches its End of Life.

### But My Computer doesn't support Windows 11... What can I do?
A lot of people are in this boat, with their computers not meeting Windows 11's minimum requirements. For quite a lot of people, this is just due to Secure Boot being disabled, which you can fix by entering your BIOS and enabling it. 

A quick warning: Sometimes enabling Secure Boot requires disabling "CSM", which may brick your windows install, and you may need to reinstall windows. If you would like some help with this, head along to r/TechSupport's [Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/techsupport) or [Discord Server](https://rtech.support/discord).

For others, if your hardware is incompatible with Windows 11, you have 3 options. Either upgrade your computer's hardware, purchase a new computer which does meet the minimum requirements (almost all new PCs will), or use Linux.

### I can't afford a new computer, and Linux is scary.
Unfortunately, if you can't afford to upgrade your computer, Linux is the only option to keep your computer safe to use. The idea of using Linux may seem intimidating, however if you take it slowly, most people will find it very similar to windows, especially if most of the work you do is in a web browser.

If you want to give Linux a try r/TechSupport have a [Linux Guide](https://rtech.support/installations/install-linux/) on their website, with lots of information on how to pick a Linux Distribution, how to install it, and how to set it up for daily use.

If all you do is use a web browser, Linux will be suitable for almost everything you do. However, if you need to use specialist tools, or play games often, you may need to start using compatibility tools like Wine or Proton. On Steam, most games automatically run perfectly, fine. You can use websites like [ProtonDB](https://protondb.com) to see if games work or need special tweaks.

Most programs will work fine, however some may need some tinkering to get working. You'll often be able to find guides on how to do these online, but if you need help getting some apps working, make a post on [r/TechSupport](https://reddit.com/r/TechSupport).
