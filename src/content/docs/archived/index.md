title: My Old Site
description: An overview of all my projects
---

If you've visited my site before, you may have noticed that it now looks a lot different to how it used to look. This is because I've decided to switch over to Astro Starlight for numerous reasons, which can be seen [here](/projects/web-history).

This section is where I'm putting all of my old projects related to my old site, that aren't really relevant anymore to have in the Projects section on this new site.
